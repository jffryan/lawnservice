            How We Rate
          </h2>
          <p>
            No lawn care company is created equal, though they all tend to say
            the same things. Our research process digs deeper than a marketing
            message, promotions, and promises. We scour through company websites
            and compare their information to reliable sources like the Better
            Business Bureau, Consumer Affairs, and more. We also rely on
            verified customer reviews to understand the average customer
            experience. Our overall company rating considers features and
            services, availability, cost, and company values. We also give a
            specific rating to the most important factors – Features and
            Services, Cost, and Customer Reviews.
          </p>
          <h4 class="secondary-subhead py-3">Features & Services</h4>
          <p>
            A lawn care company's features and services are the first steps to
            understanding how they can help you. We give good ratings to
            company's that have a wide variety of services. Companies also score
            points if their services are structured in an uncomplicated service
            menu that’s easy to choose from. The best companies make it so their
            services meet most homeowners’ needs and are also simple and
            straightforward.
          </p>
          <h4 class="secondary-subhead py-3">Cost</h4>
          <p>
            Costs are more challenging to evaluate since most companies don't
            make their prices available publicly. Furthermore, the cost can vary
            greatly from person to person. To develop an accurate cost rating,
            we evaluate the savings and deals that each company offers.
            Regardless of the initial cost, companies score higher if they offer
            things like money-back guarantees, referral programs, and seasonal
            savings to help keep prices low.
          </p>
          <h4 class="secondary-subhead py-3">Customer Reviews</h4>
          <p>
            Your fellow neighbors are the most significant source of truth when
            it comes to evaluating lawn care companies. A company that looks
            good in the public’s eye likely looks good in our eyes as well. When
            we rate companies for their customer reviews, we read through
            multiple review sites as well as different company locations. Our
            rating takes a comprehensive view of the company's administrative
            processes, their quality of work, technician professionalism, and
            overall customer satisfaction.
