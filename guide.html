              The term mosquito comes from the Portuguese term ‘little fly.’
              When you see a million of these little guys flying around, you
              realize it’s a very apt term, until you get bit. Today mosquitoes
              exist on every continent outside of Antarctica, where conditions
              are too cold for their survival. They only need temperatures above
              58 degrees to thrive, and they will, if allowed to have free reign
              of any area with a stagnant pool of water.
            </p>

              Hardy Forerunner
            </h2>
            <p>
              Mosquitoes are almost always the first organism that is drawn to a
              new body of water and they are also one of the first organisms to
              leave it in search of a new living place. For this reason, they
              have been every hardy and easily thrive in many different
              climates. This process also helps them to evade predators quite
              well. Interestingly enough, although mosquitoes do require water
              in order to reproduce, once they are airborne, they can survive in
              many different conditions. In addition, warmer temperatures allow
              them to be more active, but warm and wet does not mean more
              mosquitoes, and colder and dry does not mean less.

              Droughts can help mosquitoes breed because of the stagnant water
              that sits on the ground although less rain may mean less bodies of
              water for mosquitoes to breed in. Although they are not likely to
              come out and bite during long rains, they will breed like wildfire
              in the newly created ponds of water. The truth is that these
              little flies will take advantage of every type of weather
              condition making the impact of weather on mosquitoes very minimal.

              Climate and Mosquitoes
            </h2>
            <p>
              The simple truth of the matter is that mosquitoes are able to
              adapt to change quickly, allowing them to live in many climates
              against the intellectual odds. They are a species that proves
              Darwin’s theory of evolution, because they genetically are able to
              adapt quickly to change allowing future generations to survive in
              new climates. For this reason alone, it is very hard to combat
              mosquitoes in any area, because they can change their lifecycle to
              match new conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, the northeastern U.S. states have a type of mosquito
              known as the pitcher-plant mosquito. These types of mosquitoes
              traditionally lay eggs when daylight hours start reaching a
              designated time. Over the past four decades, the genetic traits of
              this family of mosquitoes has slowly altered allowing them to
              hatch earlier and earlier in the year as temperatures starting
              warming in these states.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today the northeast U.S. has warmed by a bit over one degree
              Fahrenheit and the frost season ends earlier. Due to the genetic
              mutation the pitcher-plant mosquitoes can now hatch much earlier
              in the year, and it only took them a few decades to do so!

              In terms of the evolutionary cycle, this adaptation is quicker
              than almost every other animal species. As the earth continues to
              warm because of climate change, it is predicted that mosquitoes
              will continue to evolve coming out earlier and earlier in the
              year. So you might want to consider buying bug spray in March,
              because in some areas, mosquitoes will now be around long enough
              to declare state residency.

            <h2 class="guide_subhead">
              Impact of Weather on Mosquito-Borne Disease
            </h2>
            <p>
              It has been found that higher temperatures often are linked to the
              creation of protozoan that leads to malaria. When mosquitoes are
              present in temperatures above 59 and 64 degrees Fahrenheit, they
              are able to mature the malaria strains of Plasmodium Vivax and
              Plasmodium Falciparum. In addition, it only takes a temperature
              above 58 degrees for St. Louis Encephalistiis and West Nile Virus
              to develop in the body of a mosquito. For every additional 12
              degrees that it increases in temperature, the development rate of
              these diseases than doubles.
